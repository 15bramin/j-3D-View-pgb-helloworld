An Attempt to show 3D mesh images using Phonegap Build




Feb 07, 2014 Still in testing mode


Sorry. Presently the code works the problem is that the Webkit used by phonegap does not refresh the page and you get a double 3D image as soon as you try to move it. 

Another issue is that you get the entire github page, which is less than ideal. I am sure things will change in the near future. I am going to try the same code with CCA (Chrome-cordova-app) to see if it works better. just github search cca-helloworld



Note: Do not use the suggested script from github but instead use something like this javascript command


<script>
  this.location = 'https://github.com/hpssjellis/j-sdView-pgb-helloworld/blob/master/RugbyLineoutMaulYellow05.stl?overridemobile=true';
</script>


The indexOk.html file has some other ways of doing things.
